# How to use the autopiracy.js
1. Use Google Chrome on desktop
1. Open and login to your ikariam account
1. Open developer tools either by pressing `ctrl+shift+c` or `f12`, depending on your OS
1. Click on the pirate fortress
1. then paste the autopiracy script

* limitations:
it currently can't do auto capcha, so it will stop when the capcha code is present, you just need to enter the capcha code then enter the `autoPiracy();` in the developer console

__Happy Piracy__
